    The uiScroll is {{datasource.adapter.isLoading ? 'loading': 'relaxing'}}.
  </div>
  <div description>
    <p>
      The <em>uiScroll Adapter</em> has some read-only properties which could be used to get knowledge of the
      <em>uiScroll</em> state. The first property is <em>Adapter.isLoading</em>. It is a boolean value
      indicating whether there are any pending load requests. So, <em>datasource.adapter.isLoading = true</em>
      means that the <em>uiScroll</em> is working right now and the viewport will be updated soon. 125ms delay
      was added to the <em>Datasource.get</em> implementation in this sample.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these demos the <em>Datasource</em> is being instantiated via operator <em>new</em>. The main purpose is
      to protect <em>Adapter</em> methods/properties from too early calls. The augmentation of the
      <em>Datasource</em> object occurs during the <em>uiScroll</em> instantiating, so providing the object
      initializer into the <em>*uiScroll</em> directive (<em>datasource: IDatasource = &#123; get: ... &#125;</em>)
      may lead to problems. For example
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>TypeError: Cannot read property 'reload' of undefined</em> if you would try to call
        <em>datasource.adapter.reload()</em> method on the App component's constructor;
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'isLoading' of undefined</em> if you would try to use
        <em>&#123;<!---->&#123;datasource.adapter.isLoading&#125;<!---->&#125;</em> in the App component's
        template.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of course the problem could be avoided by writing something like <em>datasource.adapter &&
      datasource.adapter.isLoading</em>, but instantiating the <em>Datasource</em> object via operator <em>new</em>
      solves the issue by immediately setting up the <em>Adapter mock object</em> on the <em>Datasource's</em>
      constructor. It defines the adapter property and null-returning stub methods on it. The <em>uiScroll</em>
      will override this adapter property after it is integrated to the App component.
