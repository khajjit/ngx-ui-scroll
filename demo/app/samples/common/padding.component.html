    <p>
      Here the <em>Datasource.get</em> is taken from previous samples, but the settings object is completed with
      <em>padding</em> property. <em>Padding</em> is an extra space added to the visible part of the viewport for
      the purpose of determining when the items should be created/destroyed. The value is relative to the visible
      size of the viewport. <em>1.4</em> means that the <em>uiScroll</em> would request new items until
      140% of the viewport size (out of the visible part of the viewport) is filled with rendered items. That's why
      we have 5 requests on the initial load in this case. There are 3 downward requests:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>175px + 1.4 * 175px = 420px (downward space which has to be filled, when viewport's height = 175px )</li>
      <li>ceil(420px / 25px) = 17 (items that are needed to feel 420px of the downward space, when item's height =
        25px )
      </li>
      <li>ceil(17 / 7) = 3 (datasource.get calls that are needed to request 17 items, when bufferSize = 7)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And 2 upward requests:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>1.4 * 175px = 245px (upward space which have to be filled)</li>
      <li>ceil(245px / 25px) = 10 (items that are needed to feel 245px of the upward space)</li>
      <li>ceil(10 / 7) = 2 (datasource.get calls that are needed to request 10 items)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The default value of <em>padding</em> property is 0.5. The minimum value is 0.1.
    </p>
