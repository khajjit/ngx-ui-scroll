    <p>
      The <em>uiScroll</em> might work in the "infinite" mode, when items are never removed. This mode can
      be turned on via <em>infinite</em> property of the <em>settings</em> object. Setting <em>infinite</em> to true,
      we ask the scroller not to remove items that are getting out of the viewport. That's why the DOM elements
      counter value is being increased per each edge-scroll event.
